= About

FreshBooks.rb is a Ruby interface to the FreshBooks API. It exposes easy-to-use classes and methods for interacting with your FreshBooks account.

NOTE: These examples are out of date and need to be updated. I will be writing documentation for all the updates soon and will be pushing the changes to rubyforge in the near future.

= Examples

Initialization:

  FreshBooks::Base.establish_connection('sample.freshbooks.com', 'mytoken')

Updating a client name:

  clients = FreshBooks::Client.list
  client = clients[0]
  client.first_name = 'Suzy'
  client.update

Updating an invoice:

  invoice = FreshBooks::Invoice.get(4)
  invoice.lines[0].quantity += 1
  invoice.update

Creating a new item

  item = FreshBooks::Item.new
  item.name = 'A sample item'
  item.create
